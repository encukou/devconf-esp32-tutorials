\title{Wi-Fi Communication with the \abbr{ESP32}}

\begin{document}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
    You will need a set-up environment and an \abbr{ESP32} board.

\section{Wi-Fi setup}

    The \abbr{ESP32}'s predecessor, \abbr{ESP8266}, was designed as a dedicated
    Wi-Fi chip,
    and the \abbr{ESP32} is also quite a capable Wi-Fi device.
    Let's take advantage of that!


\item
    The conference's peculiar Wi-Fi setup is quite inconvenient for
    microcontrollers, but we can make our own network!

    Turn the \abbr{ESP32}'s into an access point (`AP_IF`):

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=<>]
    import network
    ap = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF)
    ap.active(True)
    ap.config(essid='<\emph{«your own name»}>', password='<\emph{«something secret»}>', channel=<\emph{«some small number»}>)
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{comment}
        Ideally, run `nmcli d wifi` on your Linux computer to see occupied
        Wi-Fi channels, and pick one you don't see.
    \end{comment}

    The `ifconfig` method can give you interface parameters – IP address,
    subnet mask, gateway and DNS server:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    print(ap.ifconfig())
    \end{lstlisting}

    Now, connect to your Wi-Fi using your computer.
    Can you ping the device?

\item
    On your computer, figure out your new IP address using:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    ip -4 a
    \end{lstlisting}

    Keep it in mind for later.

\section{HTTP Requests}

\item
    Let's try to download a file from your computer to the \abbr{ESP32}
    using HTTP.

    On your computer, create an new directory and put a small text file in it.
    Then, `cd` to the directory and start a HTTP server on port 8000
    to share the file:

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    python3 -m http.server
    \end{lstlisting}

    Meanwhile, in MicroPython, import $\mu$requests – a minimal
    reimplementation of Requests, a HTTP client library:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    import urequests
    \end{lstlisting}

    Then, request your file!

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=<>]
    response = urequests.get('http://<\emph{«your.ip.address»}>:8000/<\emph{filename.txt}>')

    print(response.status_code)
    \end{lstlisting}

    If the status code is 200 OK, see what the response text is:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    print(response.text)
    \end{lstlisting}

    Please keep in mind the HTTP connection is not encrpyted.
    With some effort, anyone can impersonate your server.

\section{UDP}

\item
    The HTTP(s) protocol is not very suitable for microcontrollers.
    There are better ones available, such as MQTT, for which there are
    libraries available.

    We, however, will use something even more low-level: UDP,
    an unreliable, connection-less unencrypted protocol.

    This code works both on your computer and on the \abbr{ESP32}.

    To send data, create a `SOCK_DGRAM` (UDP) socket and use `sendto`
    with a message and destination address.
    You need to provide a unique port number – say, 48334 for $\mu$Python:

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=<>]
    import time
    import socket

    address = ('<\emph{«destination IP address»}>', <\emph{48334}>)

    sending_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

    while True:
        message = b'Hello'
        print('Sending', message)
        sending_socket.sendto(message, address)
        time.sleep(1/2)
    \end{lstlisting}

    To receive data on a computer, you need to \emph{bind} a `SOCK_DGRAM`
    socket to a particular port. This way the operating system knows
    which program to send data to.

    It's also good to set a timeout, so if no message comes,
    your program doesn't hang.

    The IP address is not needed, though.

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=<>]
    import socket
    import time

    address = ('', <48334>)

    receiving_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    receiving_socket.bind(address)
    receiving_socket.settimeout(1/2)

    while True:
        try:
            message = receiving_socket.recv(1024)
        except OSError:
            print('No message')
        else:
            print('Got', message)
    \end{lstlisting}

    On the \abbr{ESP32}, where your program is the only thing running,
    the sender can use the \emph{broadcast address} `255.255.255.255` to send
    to \emph{all} devices in the local network.
    Also, you don't need to call `bind`.

    Keep in mind the UDP connection is not encrpyted or authenticated.
    Anyone can send anything and you won't know who a message is from.

\section{Connecting to existing Wi-Fi}

\item
    If there is an existing Wi-Fi network, you can connect to it as a “Station”
    instead of creating an Access Point.
    Use `STA_IF` in place of `AP_IF`, and `connect` in place of `config`.

    MicroPython establishes the connection in the background.
    Usually, you'll want to wait until `isconnected()` reports `True`.

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside=<>]
    import network
    import sleep

    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    wlan.connect('<\emph{«network name»}>', '<\emph{«password»}>')

    while not wlan.isconnected():
        print('Connecting....')
        sleep(1)

    print(wlan.ifconfig())  # Our IP address and other interface parameters
    \end{lstlisting}

\item
    There should be joystick broadcasting its state over Wi-Fi.
    Ask the staff for details.

    Take one of your other programs (with LEDs, motors, etc.)
    and let it react to the joystick's position.

\item
    Get a second \abbr{ESP32} and make it impersonate the joystick,
    sending different data.

\item
    Please return the gadgets when you're done experimenting.

\end{enumerate}
